# Jet-Brains-Academy---Python
My challenge was to solve at least one programming task every day in all year. During these 365 days, I did not program every day. But at least for a couple of minutes, I needed to focus on programming and remind myself where I am heading to. To become a Python developer.

I finish the Python Core track created by JetBrains. I successfully created 16 small projects. Some of them are in this Github repo together with objectives. I am a solo learner so this was great practice for me. I received the task, had to complete it, pass the test, then came the next stage where some extra features were added, removed or updated. Sometimes it didn't make much sense for me and I would do the features differently, but then I would not pass the test. So the output has to be exactly how asked. I learn OOP so the last 3 projects I completed by creating my own Classes.
